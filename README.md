### About the Experiment 

The Lecithinase Test, also known as Nagler's Reaction, aims to assess the ability of microorganisms to produce the enzyme lecithinase (phospholipase C). This enzyme hydrolyzes lecithin, a phospholipid component of egg yolk, resulting in the formation of an opaque precipitate around the bacterial colony. The test is utilized to identify and differentiate bacterial species based on their lecithinase activity, aiding in the classification of pathogens such as Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
